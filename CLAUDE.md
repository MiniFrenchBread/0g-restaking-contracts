## Project Overview

0G Restaking Contracts — Solidity contracts integrating with the Symbiotic restaking protocol to enable 0G Chain validators to participate in liquid restaking on Ethereum. Two-chain system: Ethereum (validator/vault/middleware) and 0G Chain (rewards/state).

## Architecture

### Ethereum-Side Contracts

- **ZeroGravityFactory** (`src/ZeroGravityFactory.sol`): Main entry point. Creates validator infrastructure — operator contracts (BeaconProxy), vaults, delegators, slashers via Symbiotic. Manages collateral whitelisting and satellite chain configurations.
- **ZeroGravityMiddleware** (`src/ZeroGravityMiddleware.sol`): Symbiotic middleware integration. Inherits from `SharedVaults`, `KeyManagerBytes`, `Operators`, `TimestampCapture`, `OzAccessControl`, `WeightedStakePower`. Handles slashing, operator key management, collateral weight tracking.
- **ZeroGravityOperator** (`src/ZeroGravityOperator.sol`): Operator contract using BeaconProxy pattern. Registers with Symbiotic's OperatorRegistry, opts into vaults and networks.

### 0G Chain-Side Contracts

- **RewarderFactory** (`src/RewarderFactory.sol`): Creates per-validator rewarder contracts via Create2 deterministic deployment with BeaconProxy.
- **Rewarder** (`src/Rewarder.sol`): Per-validator reward distribution. Accumulates block rewards, distributes based on weighted stake power across multiple domains (collateral types). Checkpoint-based reward tracking.
- **RestakingStates** (`src/RestakingStates.sol`): Mirrors Ethereum restaking state. Maintains balances per rewarder/account/collateral, tracks collateral weights, prevents duplicate submissions.

### Supporting

- **WeightedStakePower** (`src/WeightedStakePower.sol`): Converts stake to voting power using collateral-specific weights with checkpoint history.
- **AscendRouter** (`src/ascend/AscendRouter.sol`): Payment splitting router distributing funds to multiple receivers.
- **PauseControl** (`src/security/PauseControl.sol`): Emergency pause functionality.

### Satellite Chains

Multiple 0G Chains with distinct chain IDs can share a single Ethereum-side restaking module:

- **Main Chain**: The primary 0G Chain where validators are first registered via `createValidator()`, creating operator/vault/stake infrastructure.
- **Satellite Chains**: Additional 0G Chains that reuse the main chain's operator, vaults, and stake — no new vault or deposit required.
- **`SatelliteChainParams`**: Per-chain config (`chainType`, `rewarderFactory`, `rewarderInitCodeHash`, `customMetadata`). Managed by admin via `addSatelliteChain` / `updateSatelliteChainParams`.
- **Registration flow**: `createSatelliteValidator(pubkey, chainId, signature, info)` is permissionless — any caller can invoke it for an existing main chain validator. The contract computes the deterministic satellite rewarder address and emits `SatelliteValidatorCreated`, followed by `SatelliteBalanceSnapshot` events per vault to provide the initial `activeStake` snapshot. No validator info is stored on-chain; the blockchain node reads the events and performs BLS signature verification off-chain, ignoring invalid registrations.
- **Satellite Chain Sync**: `SatelliteBalanceSnapshot` events provide the initial `activeStake` per vault so the satellite node doesn't need to replay all historical Deposit/Withdraw/OnSlash events.
- **Key storage**: `satelliteChains` (`EnumerableSet.UintSet`), `satelliteChainParams` (mapping).

### Key Flows

1. **Validator Setup**: `Factory.createValidator()` → creates Operator (BeaconProxy) → creates Vault/Delegator/Slasher → Operator opts into vault+network → Middleware registers operator+vault
2. **Reward Distribution**: Oracle syncs Ethereum state → RestakingStates → RewarderFactory creates Rewarder → block rewards accumulated → users claim via `Rewarder.claim()`
3. **Slashing**: `Middleware.slash()` with proof hints → proportional slashing across collaterals → VetoSlasher handles veto period
4. **Symbiotic Vault Stake Semantics**: `activeStake()` = actively slashable collateral (deposits − withdrawals − active slash portion). `totalStake()` = `activeStake()` + pending withdrawals for current and next epoch.
5. **Factory Storage Patterns**: `minValidatorDeposit` (EnumerableMap) is the source of truth for iterating all collaterals (never removed). `createdVaults[operator][collateral]` maps to vault addresses.

### Blockchain Node & Consensus Integration

- Each validator node runs its own Ethereum node and reads Symbiotic events directly via the **restaking sync module**. Non-validator nodes are not required to run an Ethereum node.
- **Block proposer** reads the latest Symbiotic state changes from their ETH node and includes `SymbioticRequests` + `SymbioticSyncHeight` (h₁) in the new beacon block.
- **All validator nodes independently verify**: they read their own ETH node for blocks h₀+1 through h₁ and confirm the `SymbioticRequests` in the proposed block match exactly. The block is only accepted and signed if they match.
- **BLS signature verification** happens on every validator node (not just the proposer) when processing a `CreateVault` (ValidatorCreated) request.
- **Two parallel sync paths**:
  - **Consensus layer**: Symbiotic events → `SymbioticBalances` / `SymbioticWeights` in beacon state → effective balance calculation → reward split between native and restaking
  - **Execution layer**: Oracle → `RestakingStates` contracts → per-staker balance tracking → `Rewarder` distributes rewards proportionally
- **Effective balance**: `effectiveBalance = nativeStaked + Σ(staked_c × weight_c)`
- **Reward split**: Consensus layer creates `Withdrawals[0]` (native staker's withdrawal credential) and `Withdrawals[1]` (validator's Rewarder contract address), proportional to each side's contribution to effective balance.

## Design Patterns

- **BeaconProxy**: Upgradeable operators and rewarders
- **ERC7201 Namespaced Storage**: For upgradeable contract storage layout
- **Role-Based Access Control**: OpenZeppelin AccessControl
- **Create2**: Deterministic rewarder deployment

## Solidity Conventions

- Solidity `0.8.25`, EVM target `cancun`, optimizer 200 runs, `via_ir = true`
- Line length: 120 chars
- `int_types = "long"` (use `uint256` not `uint`)
- Double quotes for strings
- No bracket spacing (`{a: 1}` not `{ a: 1 }`)
- Multiline function headers: params first

## Documentation Conventions

- Use Mermaid for all diagrams (flowcharts, sequences, dependency graphs)
- Flowcharts: `flowchart TD` (top-down) with subgraphs for grouping
- Sequence diagrams: `sequenceDiagram` with participant aliases
- Node shapes: `["text"]` for standard boxes
- Arrows: `-->` for flow, `-->|label|` for labeled edges
- Subgraph naming: `name["Display Name"]`

## Deployment

Scripts in `script/deploy/`. Key env vars: `PRIVATE_KEY`, `ETH_RPC_URL`, `ETH_RPC_URL_HOLESKY`, `ZG_RPC`. Deployment artifacts stored in `deployments/`.

```bash
forge script script/deploy/Core.s.sol --rpc-url "$ETH_RPC" --broadcast --slow
forge script script/deploy/ZeroGravity.s.sol --rpc-url "$ETH_RPC" --broadcast --slow
forge script script/deploy/Rewarder.s.sol --rpc-url "$ZG_RPC" --broadcast --slow
```

### Bridge: Nick-method raw tx requirement (TODO before mainnet/testnet)

`script/deploy/Bridge.s.sol` currently uses **3 hard-coded devnet test private keys**
(`DEPLOYER_A/B/C_KEY`) and lets `forge script --broadcast` sign txs at runtime. This is
**only acceptable for devnet integration tests** — for mainnet/testnet the script must be
replaced with **Nick-method (keyless) deployment**:

- Construct each of the 8 deploy txs as legacy (pre-EIP-155) RLP, choose a fixed `(r, s)`
  pair (e.g. `r = s = 0x12...34`), and reverse-derive an ephemeral sender via
  `ecrecover(txHash, v, r, s)`. **Nobody holds the private key for that sender.**
- Output the 8 signed raw txs (hex) plus the 3 derived sender addresses, in the same
  format as `0g-chain-v2/tests/resources/wa0gi_precompile_raw.sh`.
- Pre-allocate gas to the 3 senders in every chain's eth-genesis.

**Why this matters (the security property Nick-method provides):**
> The sender private keys must be unknowable / destroyed after producing the raw txs.
> Otherwise an attacker on a freshly-launched chain can pre-fund those senders and
> broadcast their *own* txs from the same `(sender, nonce 0/1/2)` slots, claiming the
> deterministic addresses with attacker-controlled bytecode. Hard-coded test keys give an
> attacker exactly that capability — they only work because devnet operators and attackers
> are the same person.

`Bridge.s.sol:170-175` `getRawTxs()` is a stub that reverts. Stream A owns finishing it
before any non-devnet deployment.

## Testing Patterns

Test base class `ZeroGravityBase.t.sol` sets up the full Symbiotic infrastructure (registries, factories, services). Tests use mock tokens and create validators/operators through the factory. `RewarderBase.t.sol` provides helpers for rewarder testing on the 0G chain side.
