 * @title MockA0GIBasePrecompile
 * @notice Solidity mock of the W0G stateful precompile at `0x1002` for Foundry tests.
 * @dev Mirrors `revm/crates/precompile/src/wa0gi_base/mod.rs` semantics:
 *      - `mint(minter, amount)` callable only when `caller == storedW0GAddress`. Fails if
 *        `supply + amount > cap`. On success, increments `supplies[minter].supply`.
 *      - `burn(minter, amount)` callable only when `caller == storedW0GAddress`. Fails if
 *        `supply < amount`.
 *      - `setMinterCap(minter, cap, initialSupply)` callable only by `WA0GI_AGENCY_ADDRESS`.
 *      - `minterSupply(minter)` view returning `(cap, supply, initialSupply)`.
 *      Native-balance crediting on the W0G_ADDRESS is handled by the test harness via `vm.deal`
 *      since vm cheatcodes aren't accessible from a contract; the mock tracks per-minter caps
 *      and supplies — sufficient for verifying revert semantics and accounting.
