/**
 * @title BridgeScript
 * @notice Deploys the eight bridge contract artifacts using three deterministic deployer keys per
 *         the Schema Freeze §"固定地址部署计划".
 *
 *         The Schema mandates three ephemeral senders (`BRIDGE_DEPLOYER_A/B/C`) signing legacy
 *         (pre-EIP-155) raw txs with hard-coded `r,s` (Nick-method) so the resulting addresses are
 *         deterministic across all 0G chains. This implementation:
 *           - Uses three test private keys (devnet only) instead of full Nick-method signing.
 *             Stream A finalizes the production senders before mainnet/testnet launch.
 *           - Predicts every contract address up-front using `vm.computeCreateAddress` so that
 *             the constructor of one beacon proxy can refer to a not-yet-deployed peer (Bridge ↔
 *             Agency cycle).
 *           - Records all eight addresses to `deployments/bridge-<chainId>.json`.
 *
 *         Comment-format below mirrors the W0G Agency / DA registry style in
 *         `0g-geth/core/vm/wrapped_a0gi_base.go:255-257`:
 *           Sender A nonce 0: BridgeImpl
 *           Sender A nonce 1: BridgeBeacon = UpgradeableBeacon(BridgeImpl, governanceOwner)
 *           Sender A nonce 2: BridgeProxy  = BeaconProxy(BridgeBeacon, init(localCID, ERC20Beacon, AgencyProxy))
 *           Sender B nonce 0: BridgeAgencyImpl
 *           Sender B nonce 1: BridgeAgencyBeacon = UpgradeableBeacon(AgencyImpl, governanceOwner)
 *           Sender B nonce 2: BridgeAgencyProxy  = BeaconProxy(AgencyBeacon, init(BridgeProxy, ERC20Beacon, multisig))
 *           Sender C nonce 0: BridgeERC20Impl
 *           Sender C nonce 1: BridgeERC20Beacon = UpgradeableBeacon(BridgeERC20Impl, governanceOwner)
 *
 *         TODO: replace devnet keys with full Nick-method `(r,s)`-fixed signatures and emit raw tx
 *         hex from `getRawTxs()` to be consumed by the chain-spec tooling.
